## Discussion
* You have until Sunday Aug 21 23:59 UTC to vote on our governance documents (no style nits PLEASE!)  https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/pull/45
  * It appears that consensus has been removed and all voting will be lazy consensus with 72 hours time slots, condorcet for PMC elections. After discussing it, it seems fine.
  * see https://voxpupuli.org/docs/ for further VP details
* Migrate puppetlabs-splunk to voxpupuli's namespace
* eputnam is the newest Puppet module engineer, started this week!
* google docs sucs for writing markdown. We're switching to etherpad!

## Reviews
### puppetlabs-apache
* what to do with milestone'd backwards incompatible PRs? Apache defaults have changed while module defaults have stayed the same, but any major rewrite of the module will not be using PRs directly as it will be a full rewrite. Should we close the milestone ones? No, we are leaving them alone.
