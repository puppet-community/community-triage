## Discussion
* Soft module dependencies! Raised by https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nodejs/pull/233 (related: http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/garethrushgrove-puppetconf see slides 150-151)
** optional dependencies are added when branching logic may or may not need the class
** many optional dependencies should NOT be declared as normal dependencies because it creates more complicated dependency trees and thus makes it harder to get complete trees
** what about having an optional_dependency('puppetlabs-apt','>=1.8.0 < 3.0.0') kind of function that looks for the metadata of the required module and raises a helpful error message if missing?
** or having metadata.json with optional_dependency and the compiler doing something similar to above on manifest cache miss
** nibz will spec something out
