### Discussion:
- rspec crash-course. Notes:

# rspec command looks for spec/**/*_spec.rb
RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.before :suite do
  end
end

# Pass 1: parsing pass
# - load ruby files
# - parse config
# - create hash of describe/context/it to be run
# Pass 2: run tests
# - before :suite
# - iterate through describe/contexts and run it's as it
#   occures

it { expects(foo).to be_false }
describe 'again' do
  before :all do
    #hi
  end
  after :each do
    #bye
  end
  context 'more' do
    let(:foo) { "hi" }
    before :each do
      # set up stuff
    end
    it "does stuff" do
      expect(double).to be_true
    end
    it { expect { foo }.to_fail }
    it { expect { bar }.to_fail }
  end
  it { allow(foo).to receive(:foo).and_return(:bar) }
end

### puppetlabs-lvm
* 158: skipping for now; will take too long
* 153: commented

### puppetlabs-xinetd
* 81: Define service_hasstatus/hasrestart for Amazon Linux

### puppet-nginx
* #862: [discuss]
* #929: GPG -- apt_key looks fine, so yumrepo in puppet core should be investigated
* #941: puppet-strings: strings is nearing 1.0.0, file tickets at http://tickets.puppet.com/browse/PDOC
* #938: changes to default package source on Linux, seeking input on whether to use upstream or distro packaging.
  * https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html officially documents using upstream packaging and does not mention distro packaging
  * use manage_repo true/false or package_source? Only a single location to configure is best. Sounds like have manage_package => true/false, allow package_source => "nginx"/"nginx-mainline", and remove `manage_repo`
  * zleslie: one example is to have various package_name values, and if undef on a platform then skip the package resource
* #902: use_default_location

### puppetlabs-accounts
* 51: pinged

### puppetlabs-mysql
* 890: Needs more investigation.
* 884: commented 23 days ago. No response. Needs more research behind impact of #813.
* 917: commented.
* 912: commented and closed
* 904 + 900 + 890: Hunner will fix.

### puppetlabs-firewall
* 670: commented

### puppetlabs-apt
* 623: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/pull/623

### puppetlabs-apache
* 1434: low priority, because backwards incompatible and 1434 provides a knob to fix that
* what to do with milestone'd backwards incompatible PRs? Apache defaults have changed while module defaults have stayed the same, but any major rewrite of the module will not be using PRs directly as it will be a full rewrite. Should we close the milestone ones? No, we are leaving them alone.

### puppetlabs-mongodb
* can we tag the latest merges?
