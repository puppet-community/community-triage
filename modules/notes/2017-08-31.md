# Module PR Triage 2017-08-31

## Participants:
* Hunner
* eputnam


### Discussion:
- [ewoud] On behalf of mmoll: a puppetlabs-puppet_authorization release would be nice. The only change is allowing newer dependencies and that should be compatible.
- [ewoud] A new puppetlabs-apache release would be great since it removes the last deprecation warnings

### puppetlabs-postgresql
* 805: commented, backwards incompatible
* 775: See discussion on 2016-07-28, and following
- The epic for tracking hashes-as-hiera-bindings is MODULES-3661
- Profiles are generally user-specific and difficult to make abstract, which is why the module's API is generally non-prescriptive in the first place
- How can we teach users to codify their infrastructure in a profile? What does a good profile look like?
- It seems that explicit hiera_*() queries from profiles is better than parameters
- queries can use previously returned answers
- queries can be used in loops
- queries can have different hiera queries, though this could also be viewed as a negative as it could easily make things more confusing
- Would it be *so* bad to block users from this pattern, if they may need to use it as a stepping stone to reach the next level of "profile abstracting define declarations"?
- Con: Progressing beyond this would require a large code and/or data refactor
- Pro: Users new to puppet can write yaml more easily than requiring them to write profiles THEN write yaml
- Alterate idea, create a <module name>::profile::hiera that is a class with parameters of empty hashes to create resources
* 822: needs investigation based on MODULES-4144
* 831: needs lower bound of concat dependency to be >= 2.0.0 (when the force parameter was disabled) and then merge
* 834

### puppet-nginx
* #862: [discuss]
* #929: GPG -- apt_key looks fine, so yumrepo in puppet core should be investigated
* #941: puppet-strings: strings is nearing 1.0.0, file tickets at http://tickets.puppet.com/browse/PDOC
* #938: changes to default package source on Linux, seeking input on whether to use upstream or distro packaging.
  * https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html officially documents using upstream packaging and does not mention distro packaging
  * use manage_repo true/false or package_source? Only a single location to configure is best. Sounds like have manage_package => true/false, allow package_source => "nginx"/"nginx-mainline", and remove `manage_repo`
  * zleslie: one example is to have various package_name values, and if undef on a platform then skip the package resource
* #902: use_default_location
