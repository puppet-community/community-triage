# Module PR Triage 2016-06-30
## Participants:
* Hunner
* bmjen
* dev_el_ops
* tphoney
* HelenCampbell
* Karmix

## Discussion
* Jenkins and travis != "ci" because we are not integrating anything
* apache third party modules cause a maintenance burden, where we do not know whether there is enough payoff for customers. (tphoney to ticket and look into)
Steps to improve or at least tackle
  * investigate apache next epic, and remove garbage fire
  * apache puppet 4 release, remove plugin installation apt or rpm
  * bump concat version in apache 
  * puppetlabs-passenger investigate
  * remove apache 2.2 crud

* travis ci is having trouble to keep up and keeps dropping github notifications. Closing and re-opening PRs causes travis to pick them up

## Reviews
### puppetlabs-apache
* 1423: merged
* 1434: low priority, because backwards incompatible and 1434 provides a knob to fix that
* 1467: merge?
* 1471: merged
* 1474: tests fail, dropped in favour of 1486 + 1487
* 1486: same changes as 1487 and conflicts with 1474. David to rebase 1486 and 1487
* 1475: waiting for rekick, tphoney to look tomorrow
* 1480: merged
* 1490: logic needs rework
* 1491: moved to 1494
* 1494: to be merged after travis woes subside
