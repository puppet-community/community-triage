# Module PR Triage Notes 2015-05-14

## Participants:
* Hunner
* bmjen
* _morgan
* jtpuppet
* DavidS
* cyberious
* nibz
* tphoney

## Discussion:
* [ACTION] Hunner: sync the labels across the modules
* branching strategy
  * "stable" is not useful branch name
  * One proposal: ditch "master" and use "2.x" and "3.x" etc. and set the latest one as the default branch
  * Another: use .y branches + master to track minor releases
  * [ACTION] Come up with requirements, then proposal, then email to puppet-dev
* [ACTION] Add module release process to CONTRIBUTING.md
* [ACTION] Hunner: Move nodejs & corosync to puppet-community
* [ACTION] nibz: turn on pcci voting
* [ACTION] Hunner: create openstack group for rabbitmq, mongodb, mysql and add crinkle, nibz, emilienm, sbadia

## Reviewed
### puppetlabs-stdlib
* 445 & 444 conn_validator
  * validate_connection rename?
  * a single type with providers instead of http_* and tcp_*
  * This should go into puppet-community
  * [ACTION] nibz: Email to puppet-dev mailing list about it moving to puppet community, pick a name, pick the API, and use cases.
* 329: closed, not reproducible
* 326: soft reject

### puppetlabs-apache
* MODULES-2011 multiple instances request
  * Chef does multiple httpd instances https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/httpd

  * Would need all classes (mod, configs, etc) converted to defines and take instance names
