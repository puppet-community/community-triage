## Discussion
* cutting everything over to pl-apt 2.xâ€¦ gets rid of warnings, but requires major bump
* dropping puppet 4 would be bad, but dropping 10.04
* drop rhelish 5 stuff
* drop puppet 2.7 anywhere (maybe just stdlib?)
* do the above in all the supported modules
* moving time for this meeting to UTC! Is 16:00-17:00 or 17:00-18:00 better?
  * keep at 17:00 for at least another week, since that's when it is now
  * need to email out to puppet-dev@ about change and okay'ing change (Hunter)
