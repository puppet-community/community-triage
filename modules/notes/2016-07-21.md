# Module PR Triage 2016-07-21

## Participants:

* dev_el_ops

## Discussion
* inifile module cannot purge whole sections, only settings. The rhn config file contains sections-per-repo and it would be nice to be able to purge these by name. There is no previous ticket or PR around this idea.
* Should we hardcode in httpoxy blocks in modules? Changing configfiles and restarting services in a bugfix release may be not recommended. Should provide a way to disable in case of edge cases? Or just hardcode and make disableable if someone complains.
* haproxy may drop 1.4 compatibility, as well as older platforms (ubuntu 10/12/14.04, debian 6/7, redhats 5/6, puppet 3.x). TBD
