## Discussion
* What to do with create_resources patterns that proliferate our modules and hinder adoption of proper profile-level abstraction practices? "What is the problem, and what is a better solution?" This should become ticketed work, investigate how widespread in modules. Is it used by many customers ? Education issues about abstraction of profiles? What possible alternatives are there, a function to parse hashes into resources ? update Hiera to handle multiple keys ? will beginner users ever use this ? Do expert users follow this pattern ? - TP to create epic
