## Discussion
* pl-apache passenger is not currently working due to upstream packaging issues. We are waiting for upstream packaging fixes as fixing in the module will cause more issues down the line. Further to this, it was noted that when we drop 2.2 support, it would be a good time to remove passenger and other problem modules.
* pl-apache:  adding custom content in an apache vhost conf with concat::fragment is hard, so we should make an apache::vhost::custom_fragment that allows passing a vhost title and order parameter and wraps a concat::fragment resource to put the content in the desired location in the apache vhost .conf file.


## Reviews
### puppetlabs-concat
* 368: [ACTION] bmjen to comment "show_diff on fragments should be hard-coded to false"


### puppetlabs-apache
* 1259: [ACTION] This ability can be provided by apache::custom_config, though this is not obvious so pabelanger is going to submit a PR to make an apache::vhost::custom_content that simply wraps the custom_config define (and updates the confdir parameter to point to the expected location for a vhost, if needed)


### puppetlabs-mysql
* 763: [ACTION] Hunner to rebase and resubmit
* 773, 774: everything was merged meanwhile


### puppetlabs-tomcat
* 108: was closed and now the work has been moved to 109 we don't understand tomcat enough to review this. [ACTION] bmjen to educate us on how to tomcat
* 109: bmjen is still looking into this along with karmix, the PR needs split into smaller PRs or a single PR with commits per functional area
