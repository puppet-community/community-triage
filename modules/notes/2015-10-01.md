  * Looks good; needs work; commented
* Package provider fact https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/pull/534 
  * merged
* service provider function https://gist.github.com/asasfu/e00eaf76f37141fca083 
  * complex pattern requires modifying every module to support it; use collector override instead
