## Participants:
* Hunner
* eputnam
* fraq

## Discussion
* Kittens! http://www.bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/ strategy!
* We should run through the past reviews to look for anything that is closed or merged to delete... DONE
* VP governance discussion:
    * lazy consensus is important and should apply widely. The "mailing list" paragraph enumerates a list of like-things to which lazy consensus should apply, one of which is "policy shift" ie governance changes (See issue #83)
    * the charter needs the email list linked
    * the charter needs number-per-paragraph (rules) similar to http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm#initial%20set
    * for context, https://www.urbit.org/posts/constitution/ is another governance document that we may be able to take verbiage from
    * LC does not distinguish between PMC and non-PMC, so votes are equal: "The PMC has final say over who can become a committer and will use lazy consensus for approval."
* VP has a kanban! https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/projects/1

### puppetlabs-postgresql
* 775: See discussion on 2016-07-28
* 764: commented - test failures need to be looked at

### puppetlabs-apache
* 1434: low priority, because backwards incompatible and 1434 provides a knob to fix that
* what to do with milestone'd backwards incompatible PRs? Apache defaults have changed while module defaults have stayed the same, but any major rewrite of the module will not be using PRs directly as it will be a full rewrite. Should we close the milestone ones? No, we are leaving them alone.
