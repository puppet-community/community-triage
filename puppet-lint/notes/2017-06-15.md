# Planning

* Rubocop - needs to meet 1.8.7+. Mike started a spike but it was for 2.3+. We can support 1.9+ instead if it's targeted to the 3.0 branch.
* 3.0.0 milestone deadline set to May 5th!

# Issues and PRs
* 568 - Disable the check in the 3.0.0 branch (rnelson0)
* 586 - Continue if a single file is unparseable; currently stops on the first one (rnelson0)
* [708](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/pull/708) - Ben will track down Jean and review (binford2k)
* [696](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/pull/696) - Review for 2.x or 3.x (needs a reviewer)
* [692](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/issues/692) - Needs some doc updates, Ben will review (binford2k)

# Other
Rob Nelson has been running the calls for the past few months, but has other commitments preventing him from giving this project the time it needs currently. He is requesting assistance in running the calls and hoping that someone else can take the reins eventually.
* Ben spoke with Lindsey Smith who will float this idea to the PDK team.
* Glenn will float this idea to the modules team.
