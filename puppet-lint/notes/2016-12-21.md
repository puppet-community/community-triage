# Planning

* How to leverage the puppet parser API? Would require adding the puppet gem and its dependencies. This would affect ability to detect issues with older syntax and possibly affect tools like Atom that leverage the linter. (3.x)
 * Validation ([586](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/pull/586)) - looks good
  * Enable app orchestration
  * Continue if a single file is unparseable (currently stops)
 * Pulling it in for lexing and check logic - up in the air
* New plugins that are non-core ([example](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/pull/235)) - one community plugins repo, with individual gems in their own directory. Those gems can be one plugin or multiple plugins. (1Q17)
* Existing plugins in core, allow to be applied by groups, and also capture other metada. Example of groups are style guide plugins, site manifest plugins, etc. (3.0.0)
 * plugin group, documentation reference, description, enable/disable
  * rake spec should flag missing docrefs
* Spike for token getters/setters ([584](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/pull/584/files)) (3.0.0)
* Set a regular cadence for puppet-lint triage and planning sessions (Rob Nelson)
* Drop Ruby 1.8.7 support in Puppet 3 ([503](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/issues/503), [606](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint/pull/606))
