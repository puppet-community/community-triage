## Pull Requests

* All triaged

### Puppet

##### For discussion

##### For Review / Needs Work
* [(PUP-4760)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [Service type should not retrieve ensure status when not needed (PR #4038)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4038)
  - Michael commented that this change seems safe. Should we proceed?
  - Reviewed potential impact to API consumers. Seems like a reasonable improvement, and most consumers would probably behave like `puppet resource` and not see an issue.
* [(PUP-5617)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5617) [enable keepalive on the TCP socket opened with the master (PR #4508)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4508)
  - This is looking good - we just want to poke it in Windows to make sure all is well.
  - We need to find a sprint to dedicate time to this in.
  - Ruby bug fix will be backported into 2.0 within the next month (doesn't actually affect PR).

##### Merged

* [(PUP-5637)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5637) [Add ExecReload= on Puppet 3.x systemd unit (PR #4576)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4576)

##### Closed

##### Waiting for updates

* [(PUP-5291)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5291) [fix "stream closed" problem with SSH transport (PR #4304)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4304)

* [(PUP-5616)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5615) [fixes to improve error display (PR #4507)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4507)
  - At a glance seems good, but we lack a lot of device knowledge. More validation and discussion would be good.
  - Pinged Stan, who is working on device support, to look at this.
* puppethack: [(PUP-5482)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5482) [Flag that a type could not be found (PR #4427)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4427)
  - Josh suggested putting this behind a feature flag. Waiting on updates from contributor.

  - Waiting for updates from contributor
  - Michael is working with Felix on this
* [(PUP-5356)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5356) [(PUP-5356) check_puppet.rb does not work on CentOS 7 (#4477)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4477)
  - Waiting for response from contributor
  - Pinged on ticket - Let's wait one more week and then close.
* [(PUP-5646)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5646) [pad seed fqdn_rand seed with max number (PR #4543)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4543)
  - tl;dr: fqdn.rand is weird.
  - Discuss and make sure we understand what this will do. Branan thinks this is expected behavior, and changing fqdn.rand could cause undesired behavior for others.
  - Probably best to create a new function that works properly as a prng and deprecate fqdn.rand.
* [(PUP-5356)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5356) [(PUP-5356) check_puppet.rb does not work on CentOS 7 (#4477)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4477)

  - Ready for review
  - Blocked on our end, haven't had time to bring it into a sprint.
