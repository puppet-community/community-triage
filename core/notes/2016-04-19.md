  - Looks reasonable, but would be a change to some long-standing logging behavior, so want to socialize this a bit before merging.

  - Moved to new PR. Looks reasonable, Michael is going to look at the specs. Josh pointed out that we have talked about extracting mount from core so it might make sense to move the
    cross-type logic in the PR from file to mount.
