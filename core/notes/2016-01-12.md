##### For discussion

* [(PUP-5609)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5609) [Protect shared state with filesystem lock (PR #4501)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4501)
  - Seems good, at first glance. Let's discuss during triage. We'll want to do more testing as well.
* [(PUP-5616)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5615) [fixes to improve error display (PR #4507)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4507)
  - At a glance seems good, but we lack a lot of device knowledge. More validation and discussion would be good.
  - Jo fixed the broken test - PR is waiting on us.
* [(PUP-5617)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5617) [enable keepalive on the TCP socket opened with the master (PR #4508)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4508)
    - Josh and Kylo have taken review passes at this, and it's looking good. Kylo wants some more Windows testing and ideas from Windows folks on how to do that.
* [(PUP-5646)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [pad seed fqdn_rand seed with max number (PR #4543)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4543)
  - Discuss and make sure we understand what this will do. Branan thinks this is expected behavior, and changing fqdn.rand could cause undesired behavior for others.
  - Contributor is waiting for response from us.
* puppethack: [(PUP-5462)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5462) [Small improvements to module generator (PR #4396)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4396)
  - PR has been updated and tests are passing
  - Looks like we left off needing some more input from the modules team. See if we can ping any of them during discussion.
* [(PUP-5360)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5360) [Feature/autorelation defined types (PR #4337)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4337)
    - Contributor responded but hasn't answered Josh's questions. We should figure out what to do with this PR.
* [(PUP-5291)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5291) [fix "stream closed" problem with SSH transport (PR #4304)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4304)
  - Ping Josh to look over Jo's response to his comment.
  - Jo also responded to Branan's comment.
* [(PUP-4760)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [Service type should not retrieve ensure status when not needed (PR #4038)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/
pull/4038)
  - Michael commented that this change seems safe. Should we proceed?
  - Last discussion that happened indicated that we might want to make sure this won't impact mco plugins that expect service status.
* [(PE-12534)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PE-12534) [Fix yumrepo param specifying false fail (PR #4450)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4450)
