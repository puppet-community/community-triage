##### For discussion

* [(PUP-5609)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5609) [Protect shared state with filesystem lock (PR #4501)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4501)
  - Seems good, at first glance. Let's discuss during triage. We'll want to do more testing as well.
* [(PUP-5616)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5615) [fixes to improve error display (PR #4507)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4507)
  - At a glance seems good, but we lack a lot of decide knowledge. More validation and discussion would be good.
* [(PUP-5617)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5617) [enable keepalive on the TCP socket opened with the master (PR #4508)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4508)
  - Seems fine at a glance - let's discuss sanity of the idea of the change at triage.
  - Also need to figure out what's going on with the test failure.
* [(PUP-1293)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1293)) [Don't ignore status when using upstart provider](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4525)
  - This is probably fine, just a backport. We can probably merge at triage.
  - Also ensure that we don't need to backport any acceptance tests that went with this originally.
* [(PUP-5646)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [pad seed fqdn_rand seed with max number (PR #4543)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4543)
  - Discuss and make sure we understand what this will do. Branan thinks this is expected behavior, and changing fqdn.rand could cause undesired behavior for others.
* puppethack: [(PUP-5462)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5462) [Small improvements to module generator (PR #4396)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4396)
  - PR has been updated and tests are passing
  - Looks like we left off needing some more input from the modules team. See if we can ping any of them during discussion.

##### For Review / Needs Work

  - We need to thoroughly test this one, as it has a high risk for breakage.
  - Seems OK, but would like to get a better understanding of how this actually works before hitting the button


##### Merged

* (maint)[Minor fixes to the pkgng pacakge provider](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4472)
