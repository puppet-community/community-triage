  - Pinged a few people who have had past experience with this issue to see if they can weigh in. Branan to see if this seems like a sane model going forward.

* [(PUP-6048)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-6048) [always create a basic default environment (PR #4788)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4788)
  - Contributor closed based on conversation in the ticket. Leaving the ticket itself open for docs followup.

* [(PUP-5825)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5825) [use systemctl is-enabled to determine service enable state (PR #4770)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4770)
  - Scheduled review for our upcoming sprint where we will tackle several related tickets around service providers on redhat.

* [(PUP-4760)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [Service type should not retrieve ensure status when not needed (PR #4038)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4038)
  - Also scheduled for this upcoming sprint.

* [(PUP-1364)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1364) [Yum support for arch in packages (PR #4811)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4811)
  - Another mini-theme tickled here around yum enhancements. There are several related tickets and we scheduled this cluster out a couple sprints.

* [(PUP-5482)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5482) [Cache type misses (PR #4818)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4818)
  - Haus added benchmarks and updated to ensure there was still a gain with latest changes on master. Looking for final signoff from Henrik.

* [(PUP-6095)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-6095) [Service provider should not die if a service is in degraded state (PR #4819)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4819)
  - Looks reasonable, pinged contributor to sign CLA.

  - Looks reasonable, Michael is going to look at the specs. Josh pointed out that we have talked about extracting mount from core so it might make sense to move the
    cross-type logic in the PR from file to mount.

* Refactor load_custom_oid_file (PR #4827)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4827)
  - Merged

  - This looks reasonable. We are thinking this should be a setting since these aren't standard settings. Also needs a commit message update and spec test fixes.

* [(PUP-6120)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-6120) [Change the pip provider to use the pip CLI directly (PR #4832)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4832)
