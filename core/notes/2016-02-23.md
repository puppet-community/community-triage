## Actions

* Michael: [(PUP-4760)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [Service type should not retrieve ensure status when not needed (PR #4038)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4038)
  - Michael is going to spend some time with this post-direct puppet
  - Reviewed potential impact to API consumers. Seems like a reasonable improvement, and most consumers would probably behave like `puppet resource` and not see an issue
  - Waiting for contributor to retarget at master
  - We'll need to move this into a sprint once that happens so we can spend more time on it

* Branan to review (when we can pull into a sprint): [(PUP-5360)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5360) [Feature/autorelation defined types (PR #4337)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4337)
