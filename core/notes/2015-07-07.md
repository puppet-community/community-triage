  - joshcooper to recommend targeting puppet#stable, handle proxy user and password, no_proxy?
  - nibalizer said pip toolmasters preferred that we use json api because it can be cached in fastly
  - Pinged nibalizer about updating pip provider to use json, added benefit of leveraging puppet's http connection handling

  - Should this be rolled up into `summarize` instead of creating another option?
  - Would be helpful to see output where this information is useful
  - Can this be handled through an application (in a module) that post-processes the report instead?
  - joshcooper thought RI wrote something like this, will look into it
  - should showing changes be different than showing summary?
  - some inconsistency that display_changes returns a string as opposed to displaying the changes?
* [(PUP-4634)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4634) [Add agent timing to report (PR #4042)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4042) 18m20s

  - joshcooper to comment
  - haven't had time to review, will look at it before next week
* [(PUP-2509)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2509) [Some AIX user attributes should be uppercase (PR #4059)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4059) 19m33s
  - Needs ticket & test
  - provider was downcasing values it read in, and comparing against manifest. This change could break users that have lowercase attributes on the manifest and were relying on puppet to downcase the current value prior to comparing.
  - need to understand why provider was downcasing attribute values
  - joshcooper to comment on PR
  - haven't had time to review, will look at it before next week
* [(PUP-4814)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4814) [Use %SystemRoot% for scheduled tasks (PR #4061)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4061) 20m55s
