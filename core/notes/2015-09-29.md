* (PUP-???) [Resource type zpool create options (PR #4305)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4305)

      providers do similar things.

    - Waiting for our AIX pipelines to be completed. Once they are up, we can verify this change and merge if it works.
    - Also need contributor to ammend commit message with ticket number.
* [(PUP-4760)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [Service type should not retrieve ensure status when not needed (PR #4038)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4038)
    - This one is blocked on our end, in that we haven't had a chance to bring it into a sprint yet.
    - We need to thouroughly test this one, as it has a high risk for breakage.
* [(PUP-4619)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4619) [sort fstab entries (PR #3953)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3953)
    - Blocked on our end. First on our list is to merge PUP-1072, which is in our current sprint.
    - We need to spend the necessary time to review and merge this and previous PRs.
* [(PUP-598)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-598) [Add gpasswd support to Group provider (PR #3687)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3687)
    - There is a related PR up for a fix with the same root cause as this one.
    - We want to fix both issues with the same PR.
    - Haven't had time to bring this into a sprint yet.

  - We are a skeleton crew this week, so we'll probably want to pull this into a sprint in the near future.
* [(PUP-5290)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5290) [Catch and log exceptions raised by saving to cache (PR #4303)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4303)
    - Potential issues with the cache save failing and puppet continuing its run.
    - With this change, for example, the agent could fail to save the CA cert locally and the run would continue, which would
      result in lots of other SSL errors later on in the run.
    - Might not be a safe PR.
