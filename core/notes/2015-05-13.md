  - Potentially impacted by [PUP-4368](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4368), extending the file type to allow this work to be modular
  - We should get eric0's opinion on this, if it is something that should be pulled in. Need to check if he's already given the okay or not.
  - Similar to [PR #3675](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3675) in that this might actually need to go into a module, not into core
  - Maybe merge this in, and then add it to the list of things to be split out when we go modular.
  - Ping Chris, Kylo, Eric0, decide on concrete next steps.
  - Josh had a new question regarding the implementation of "escaping" URLs for the indirector; may not work for other URL types; Felix to investigate.
