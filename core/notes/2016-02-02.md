  - Waiting for updates from contributor
  - Michael is working with Felix on this
* [(PUP-5609)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5609) [Protect shared state with filesystem lock (PR #4584)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4584)
  - Merged but had to revert because it caused issues running `puppet apply` back-to-back.
  - Waiting for response from contributor
* [(PUP-5734)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5734) [detect malformed metadata dependencies (PR #4590)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4590)

  - Would be good to spend a bit of time on our end planning out what we think this should look like.
