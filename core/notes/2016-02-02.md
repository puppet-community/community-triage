  - Michael commented that this change seems safe. Should we proceed?

  - Waiting for contributor to retarget at master
* [(PUP-5291)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5291) [fix "stream closed" problem with SSH transport (PR #4304)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4304)

  - At a glance seems good, but we lack a lot of device knowledge. More validation and discussion would be good.
  - Asking Stan to give a final review and merge this PR

  - Merged but had to revert because it caused issues running `puppet apply` back-to-back.
  - Waiting for response from contributor
