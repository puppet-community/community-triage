## Pull Requests

### Puppet

##### For discussion

##### For Review / Needs Work

##### Merged

* [(PUP-5802)]((https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5734))[Make the Yum package provider correctly parse epochs (#4616)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4616)
  - May not actually allow comparing epochs, but it's definitely a valid bug fix. Merged.

##### Closed

##### Waiting for updates

* [(PUP-4760)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4760) [Service type should not retrieve ensure status when not needed (PR #4038)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4038)
  - Michael commented that this change seems safe. Should we proceed?
  - Reviewed potential impact to API consumers. Seems like a reasonable improvement, and most consumers would probably behave like `puppet resource` and not see an issue.
  - Waiting for contributor to retarget at master
  - We'll need to move this into a sprint once that happens so we can spend more time on it
* [(PUP-5616)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-5615) [fixes to improve error display (PR #4507)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4507)
  - At a glance seems good, but we lack a lot of device knowledge. More validation and discussion would be good.
  - Asking Stan to give a final review and merge this PR
  - Assigned the JIRA ticket to Stan

  - Waiting for updates from contributor
  - Michael is working with Felix on this

  - Waiting for response from contributor

##### Blocked
* [(PUP-4634)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4634) [Add timing metrics to report (PR #4042)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/4042)
  - Ready for review
  - Blocked on our end, haven't had time to bring it into a sprint.
  - Would be good to spend a bit of time on our end planning out what we think this should look like.
* [(PUP-598)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-598) [Add gpasswd support to Group provider (PR #3687)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3687)

  - We want to fix both issues with the same PR.
  - Haven't had time to bring this into a sprint yet.
